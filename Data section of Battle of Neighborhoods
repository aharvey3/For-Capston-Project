Data

we will need to access following data:

- The neighbourhoods and districts in Atlanta from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_Atlanta

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these neighborhoods, districts, and localities of Atlanta from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need the following venues data:
  - the BBQ venues of the districts
  - the offices venues of the districts
  - the high schools venues of the districts
  - the universities venues of the districts

We will then analyze all aspects of the data in order to come up with logistically the best location to place a BBQ restaurant. .
